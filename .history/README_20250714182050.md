A simple, fast, and vectorized Python library for Smart Money Concept (SMC) analysis, perfect for local feature extraction, strategy backtesting, and quantitative analysis.

This toolkit is designed for traders and developers who need to programmatically identify SMC structures without relying on third-party charting platforms. Its vectorized nature (powered by Pandas and NumPy) ensures high performance, making it suitable for processing large historical datasets for tasks like training Reinforcement Learning agents.

## Features

- **Vectorized & Fast**: Leverages Pandas and NumPy for efficient calculations.
- **Core SMC Concepts**: Accurately identifies:
  - Swing Highs & Lows
  - Break of Structure (BOS)
  - Change of Character (CHoCH)
  - Order Blocks (OB)
  - Fair Value Gaps (FVG)
- **Multi-Structure Analysis**: Differentiates between primary (main) and internal market structures.
- **Built-in Visualization**: Includes a ready-to-use Matplotlib function to instantly plot and verify results.

## Installation

```bash
pip install smc-toolkit
```

## Quickstart

Here is a brief example of how to analyze the NASDAQ index data from Yahoo Finance.

```python
import yfinance as yf
from smc_toolkit import process_smc_with_internal, extract_ob_blocks, extract_fvg, plot_smc_structure

# --- Get some data ---
# For this example, we'll get NASDAQ data for 6 months on a daily interval
data = yf.download(tickers='^IXIC', period='6mo', interval='1d')

# The toolkit expects a multi-index dataframe with 'code' and 'date'
# and columns: 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'.
# Let's format the data accordingly.
data['code'] = '^IXIC'
data = data.reset_index().set_index(['code', 'Date'])
data.columns = [col.lower() for col in data.columns] # Ensure lowercase column names
data = data.rename_axis(['code', 'date']) # Rename index to match expected 'date'

# Step 1: Process basic structures (Swing/BOS/CHoCH) for main and internal timeframes
structure = data.groupby('code', group_keys=False).apply(
    process_smc_with_internal, 
    swing_size=50, 
    internal_size=5
)

# Step 2: Extract Order Blocks (OB)
ob_df = structure.groupby('code').apply(extract_ob_blocks).reset_index(drop=True)

# Step 3: Extract Fair Value Gaps (FVG)
fvg_df = structure.groupby('code').apply(extract_fvg).reset_index(drop=True)

# Step 4: Visualize the results
plot_smc_structure(code='^IXIC', result_df=structure, ob_df=ob_df, fvg_df=fvg_df)
```

Running the code above will generate a plot similar to this:

## Output DataFrames

### `structure` DataFrame

This is the main DataFrame with all candles and their calculated SMC attributes.

| Column                | Description                                                                 |

| `bos`                 | `1` for a bullish BOS, `-1` for a bearish BOS.                              |
| `bos_level`           | The price level of the swing point that was broken.                         |
| `choch`               | `2` for a bullish CHoCH, `-2` for a bearish CHoCH.                          |
| `choch_level`         | The price level of the swing point that was broken to cause the CHoCH.      |
| `int_...`             | The same columns prefixed with `int_` for the internal structure.           |

### `ob_df` (Order Blocks) DataFrame

Contains the identified Order Blocks.

| Column       | Description                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ob_time`    | Timestamp of the candle that forms the Order Block.         |
| `start_time` | Start time of the price leg that led to the CHoCH.          |
| `end_time`   | End time of the price leg (timestamp of the CHoCH).         |
| `ob_top`     | Top price level of the Order Block.                         |
| `ob_bottom`  | Bottom price level of the Order Block.                      |
| `ob_type`    | `bullish` or `bearish`.                                     |
